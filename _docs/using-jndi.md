This tutorial outlines the use of Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) to create JMS objects including ConnectionFactories and Topic or Queue destinations. The [Publish/Subscribe]({{ site.baseurl }}/publish-subscribe) and other tutorials use the approach of programmatically creating these JMS objects, which is usually recommended for developers but JNDI is also a good option which increases the portability of your JMS application code.

In this tutorial, we’ll follow the same flow as the [Persistence with Queues]({{ site.baseurl }}/persistence-with-queues) tutorial but use JNDI to retrieve the JMS Objects.

Obtaining JMS objects using JNDI requires a lookup of a Solace messaging resource by its reference in a JNDI store and then creating a local JMS object from the information returned. With the local JMS object available, the client can start using the associated resource:

Solace messaging provides a JNDI service to make this integration easy, which we will use here. Alternatively, it is possible to use other JNDI standard compliant services, such as an LDAP-based JNDI store on a remote host as described in the [Solace Documentation]({{ site.docs-jms-establishing-connections }}){:target="_top"}

### Assumptions

This tutorial assumes the following:

*   You are familiar with Solace [core concepts]({{ site.docs-core-concepts }}){:target="_top"}.
*   You have an understanding or you can refer to the [Persistence with Queues]({{ site.baseurl }}/persistence-with-queues) tutorial for
    *   the Java Messaging Service (JMS) basics
    *   how to send and receive a message using the JMS API
    *   how obtain the Solace JMS API
*   You have access to Solace messaging with the following configuration details:
    *   Connectivity information for a Solace message-VPN configured for guaranteed messaging support
    *   Enabled client username and password
    *   Client-profile enabled with guaranteed messaging permissions.
    *   Admin level rights to configure the message-VPN

One simple way to get access to Solace messaging quickly is to create a messaging service in Solace Cloud [as outlined here]({{ site.links-solaceCloud-setup}}){:target="_top"}. You can find other ways to get access to Solace messaging below.

### Goals

The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate the use of JNDI as a way to create JMS objects. This tutorial will show you following steps:

1. How to configure the JNDI service on Solace messaging
2. How to retrieve a JMS Connection Factory using JNDI so the client can connect to Solace messaging
3. How to lookup a JMS Queue destination object using JNDI so the client can publish or subscribe to it

{% include_relative assets/solaceMessaging.md %}
{% include_relative assets/solaceApi.md %}

## Step 1: Configuring the JNDI service

This tutorial will make use of the same two JMS objects as the [Persistence with Queues]({{ site.baseurl }}/persistence-with-queues):

*   A ConnectionFactory object – Used by JMS clients to successfully connect to a message broker like a Solace message router
*   A Queue Destination – Used for publishing and subscribing to messages.

This time we will take the approach of using JNDI lookup to create these objects.

### Configuring the Solace Messaging

The following resources need to be configured through admin access to the Solace message-VPN:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Resource</th>
        <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Physical durable Queue</td>
        <td>Q/tutorial</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Connection Factory JNDI Reference</td>
        <td>/JNDI/CF/GettingStarted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Queue JNDI Reference</td>
        <td>/JNDI/Q/tutorial</td>
    </tr>
</table>

There are several ways to manage Solace messaging including:

*   Command Line Interface (CLI)
*   the Solace Element Management Protocol (SEMP) RESTful API
*   the GUI-based SolAdmin management application.

For simplicity in this tutorial, the following CLI script is provided. It will do the following:

*   Ensure to start from a known command level, enable message-VPN configuration mode

```
home
enable
configure

```

*   Create a durable queue, configure it and set the admin status for this queue. Here it will not throw an error message if the queue already exists.

```
message-spool message-vpn "VPNNAME"
! pragma:interpreter:ignore-already-exists
  create queue "Q/tutorial" primary
! pragma:interpreter:no-ignore-already-exists
    access-type "exclusive"
    permission all "delete"
    no shutdown
    exit
  exit

```

*   Properly configure the default message-VPN with the necessary JNDI configuration. This script assumes the JNDI connection factory and queue do not exist and creates them. If the JNDI connection factory or queue already exists you may need to remove the keyword “create” from the script below. The script also sets the properties of the JNDI connection factory, which will apply to the connections created when using it. Also notice how the JNDI queue reference is linked to the physical queue.

```
jndi message-vpn "VPNNAME"
  create connection-factory "/JNDI/CF/GettingStarted"
    property-list "messaging-properties"
        property "text-msg-xml-payload" "false"
        property "default-delivery-mode" "persistent"
        exit
    exit

  create queue "/JNDI/Q/tutorial"
      property "physical-name" "Q/tutorial"
      exit
  exit

```

To apply this configuration, simply log in to Solace messaging CLI as an admin user and paste the above script fragments into the CLI, replacing VPNNAME to match that of your Solace messaging solution.

{% if jekyll.environment == 'solaceCloud' %}
If connecting using Solace Cloud, obtain your management credentials by scrolling down to the Management section on the Connectivity tab

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/management-info.png)

```
ssh <management-username>@<HOST> -p 2222
Solace - Virtual Message Router (VMR)
Password:
```
{% endif %}



If using a VMR load, log in to the Solace message router CLI as an `admin` user with the default `admin` password.

```
ssh admin@<HOST>
Solace - Virtual Message Router (VMR)
Password:
```


See the [Solace Documentation - Solace Router CLI]({{site.docs-management-cli}}){:target="_top"} for more details.

## Step 2: Obtaining a JMS ConnectionFactory object using JNDI

In order to send or receive messages, an application must connect Solace messaging using a `ConnectionFactory`. The following code shows how to obtain a `ConnectionFactory` JMS object using Solace JNDI.

```java
final String CONNECTION_FACTORY_JNDI_NAME = "/JNDI/CF/GettingStarted";

String[] split = args[1].split("@");

String host = args[0];
String vpnName = split[1];
String username = split[0];
String password = args[2];

Hashtable<String, Object> env = new Hashtable<String, Object>();
env.put(InitialContext.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.solacesystems.jndi.SolJNDIInitialContextFactory");
env.put(InitialContext.PROVIDER_URL, host);
env.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, username + '@' + vpnName);
env.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, password);

InitialContext initialContext = new InitialContext(env);
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = (ConnectionFactory) initialContext.lookup(CONNECTION_FACTORY_JNDI_NAME);
```

### JMS Properties

This is a good place to talk about the JMS Properties, which provide access to Solace JMS API functionality that extends the JMS standard.

JMS Properties can be used to:

*   Configure the JNDI or JMS data connection properties such as security, connection retry or timeouts
*   Set message or message delivery properties, such as marking a message as a Reply Message, as seen in the [Request/Reply]({{ site.baseurl }}/request-reply) tutorial.
*   Set general API properties, such as when Dynamic Durables were set to enable dynamic creation of a resource in the [Persistence with Queues]({{ site.baseurl }}/persistence-with-queues) tutorial.

JMS Properties can be passed to the API in several ways, allowing flexibility to have them preset or a runtime setting. Here we show the use of `Username` as a JMS Property, which the JMS standard does not define.

Following example used above shows the configuration of the JNDI connection runtime with the Username through Initial Context:

```java
env.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, "my-username");
```

The created ConnectionFactory will inherit this, but it could be overridden using the created SolConnectionFactory object, allowing for a different username to be used for the data connection:

```java
connectionFactory.setUsername("my-username");
```

Same could have been predefined as a JVM level System property and used as default if it was not provided by the above two options:

```
-Djava.naming.security.principal=my-username
```

Or it could have also been taken as preset default from a `jndi.properties` file on the CLASSPATH, which has following line included:

```
java.naming.security.principal=my-username
```

Some JMS properties can even be configured on Solace messaging and the API will use this setting as a default, for example when the JNDI connection factory Delivery Mode property was set by the CLI script:

```
property "default-delivery-mode" "persistent"
```

The [Solace JMS Documentation - JMS Properties Reference]({{site.docs-jms-properties-reference}}){:target="_top"} provides detailed description of the use and the list of all JMS properties with options how to configure them. It is recommended to carefully consider the effect of the JMS Properties applied in order to achieve the desired configuration goal.

### Connecting to the Solace Messaging

Next, the 'ConnectionFactory' can be used the same way as described in the Persistence with Queues tutorial to create a JMS Connection, at which point your client is connected to Solace messaging and can create a JMS Session.

```java
Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
final Session session = connection.createSession(false, SupportedProperty.SOL_CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE);
```

## Step 3: Obtaining JMS Destination objects using JNDI

A Queue or Topic destination is needed to send and receive messages. When using JNDI, destination objects are looked up by their JNDI reference.

Following code will obtain a Queue for the Persistence with Queues scenario:

```java
final String QUEUE_NAME = "Q/tutorial";
final String QUEUE_JNDI_NAME = "/JNDI/" + QUEUE_NAME;
Queue queue = (Queue) initialContext.lookup(QUEUE_JNDI_NAME);
```

In contrast to the Persistence with Queues tutorial, the physical queue resource name `Q/tutorial` is not used here directly; it has been associated with `/JNDI/Q/tutorial` when the JNDI reference was created by the CLI script. Also note that same CLI script has already administratively created the physical queue object behind  `Q/tutorial` and the `Dynamic Durables` JMS Property does not need to be enabled to automatically create it.

### Sending and Receiving messages to a queue

Once the JMS queue object has been created using JNDI, producers and consumers can use it to send and receive messages the same way as described in the Persistence with Queues and other tutorials.

## Summarizing

The full source code for this example is available in [GitHub]({{ site.repository }}){:target="_blank"}. If you combine the example source code shown above results in the following source:

<ul>
{% for item in page.links %}
<li><a href="{{ site.repository }}{{ item.link }}" target="_blank">{{ item.label }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

### Getting the Source

Clone the GitHub repository containing the Solace samples.

```
git clone {{ site.repository }}
cd {{ site.repository | split: '/' | last }}
```

### Building

Building these examples is simple.  You can simply build the project using Gradle.

```
./gradlew assemble
```

This builds all of the JMS Getting Started Samples with OS specific launch scripts. The files are staged in the `build/staged` directory.


### Running the Sample

First start the `QueueProducerJNDI` to send a message to the queue. Then you can use the `QueueConsumerJNDI` sample to receive the messages from the queue.

```
$ ./build/staged/bin/queueProducerJNDI <host:port> <client-username>@<message-vpn> <client-password>
$ ./build/staged/bin/queueConsumerJNDI <host:port> <client-username>@<message-vpn> <client-password>
```

You have now successfully connected a client, sent persistent messages to a queue and received them from a consumer flow.

If you have any issues sending and receiving a message, check the [Solace community]({{ site.links-community }}){:target="_top"} for answers to common issues.
